## Notes

### Version Numbering
First number: Rewrite number. <br>
Second number: Major update number. Updates with each 'major' update. <br>
Third number: Minor update / patch update.<br>

### Issues
I'll create issue reports just so I remember what to actually fix + also to get used to the workflow. <br>
Feel free to make any issue reports if you find any bugs / inconsistencies. <br>
There's no real template just try to be as detailed as possible if you can.
